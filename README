Testing is an important task, but can be quite tedious. Having a test framework
to rely on can be useful and helps to focus on test efficency.
Cobaye is a test framework with a ncurses based interface that can run thru a 
telnet / serial connection. It also offers a batch mode to run automatic test 
sequences.

The test API is extremely simple: write your test in the 'tests' directory.
The tests must be declared using macro cobaye_declare_test with the 
struct cobaye_test that describe your test:

struct cobaye_test my_test = {
	.name = "mytest",
	.descr = "a simple test description",
	.main = my_test_main,
	.flags = TST_NO_USER,
};

cobaye_declare_test(my_test);

Then, the build system will automatically compile and embed your test case.

At run the test framework, will generate a list of all compiled tests and when
running a test, it will fork to run the test.

cobaye features are:
- cobaye_printf to display logs
- cobaye_scanf to prompt user for input
- resources embedded as blob
- report generation
- batch mode (for auto tests only)
- build flags customization for tests
- out of tree build
- handling of test sequences

For more info, check out the dummy.c test example.
